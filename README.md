Restaurant Order Management System

The Restaurant Order Management System is a modern solution that simplifies restaurant operations using QR codes. At Freshness Restaurant in Kondotty, Customers will scan a QR code at their table with their smartphones to view the menu and place orders directly. This system sends orders straight to the kitchen in real-time, speeding up service and reduce mistakes. By automating the ordering and billing processes, this system aims to make service quicker and more efficient, enhancing the overall dining experience.

Initially, the project will develop a system to generate unique QR codes for each table, allowing customers to access a digital menu on their smartphones. This digital menu will enable customers  to browse, select and customize their orders, which are then transmitted to the kitchen in real-time to ensure prompt and accurate preparation. The system will also integrate automated billing and payment features, allowing customers to settle their bills electronically. This is a web-based management tool for staff and customers will be developed to support efficient order handling and payment processing. It also helps staff stay organized with real-time updates. With easy integration into existing system and thorough testing, this system will enhance both customer satisfaction and restaurant efficiency.
